This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project Link: [youtube app](https://elegant-noyce-e141de.netlify.app/).

- Users can search the videos through Youtube API request.
- Users can check up to 5 relevant videos in this App.
- Re-write the app based on React Hook.
- Checked the same app based on class function codes [here](https://github.com/yutung-cheng/React_workshop/tree/master/videos). 

--- Warning --- 
Sometime this App might keeps showing 'Loading...', because YouTube V3 API quote exceeded daily limit is only 10k.
This means that this website has exceeded it's limit to serve videos from youtube.
(Youtube API needs to be paid, and I am only using experience account which is up to 10K per day.)
Please try this website later, sorry for the inconvenience...
